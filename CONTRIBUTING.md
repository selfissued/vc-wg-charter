# Verifiable Claims Working Group

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the
[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and
[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

## Work Mode
We invite all to contribute to the development of this charter by raising issues
and submitting PRs. All proposed changes to the document must be agreed to by
the listed chairs before merging. Other approvals may be sought, but are not
required, particularly while this document is in a draft state.

PRs will be merged at the chairs' discretion, and may be merged quickly. Please
raise an issue if changes have been made to the draft charter that you do not
agree with. However, please keep in mind that while we will strive to address
issues in a manner that is acceptable to those who have raised them, we cannot
guarantee that all issues will result in changes satisfactory to all parties,
nor that all parties will have sufficient time to review changes before they are
merged into the draft.

Before the draft charter is sent for Advisory Committee review it will be
submitted to the current VCWG for approval.
